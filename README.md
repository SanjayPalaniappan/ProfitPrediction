**Problem Statement:**
With available Startups data, stating when a startup invests different amounts in various departments such as R&D, Marketting Spend, Administration with its presence in different states, determine the profit of the startup

**Dataset:**
50_Startups.csv

**Input Columns:**
R&D (numerical data)
Marketting Spend (numerical data)
Administration (numerical data)
State (categorical data)

**Output Columns:**
Profit (numerical data)

**Approach**
We try to solve this problem, using different algorithms such as Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest and perform a comparison of which model suits the best
in identifying the solution

**Note:**
Above mentioned algorithms are built, along with their hyperparameters tuned, in order to achieve good accuracy, in terms of R^2 value
